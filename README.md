# OGRE BATTLE
> This console-based pplication introduces the benefits of objects in JavaScript. The classic game-type of the hero versus the monster is mirrored here. Both the hero and the monster are JavaScript objects and both have methods that they use to try and defeat their opponent. The winner isn't guaranteed, so pay attention to the console.
