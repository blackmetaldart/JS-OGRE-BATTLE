# JS-OGRE-BATTLE

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION
This console-based pplication introduces the benefits of objects in JavaScript. The classic game-type of the hero versus the monster is mirrored here. Both the hero and the monster are JavaScript objects and both have methods that they use to try and defeat their opponent. The winner isn't guaranteed, so pay attention to the console.

### APPROACH TAKEN

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - The cool text editor used to write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### HOW TO USE
Open the index.html in your browser and then open up the console to witness the action. Refresh the page to witness a new battle.
